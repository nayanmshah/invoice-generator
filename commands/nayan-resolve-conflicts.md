Resolve merge conflicts for a specific pull request by analyzing git history, commit messages, and code changes to make intelligent resolution decisions. Use the nayan-conflict-resolution skill methodology. For full pipeline workflows, use Orchestrator mode.

**Multi-repo:** When workspace is multi-repo, the PR belongs to one child repo. Before running git commands: determine which repo the PR targets (e.g., from `gh pr view` URL or `headRefName`). Run all git commands **inside that repo's directory**. Example: if PR is for web-app, `cd web-app` first, then `gh pr checkout`, `git rebase`, etc.

## Quick Start

1. **Provide a PR number** (e.g., `#123` or just `123`)

2. The workflow will automatically:
    - Fetch PR information (title, description, branches)
    - Checkout the PR branch
    - Rebase onto the target branch to reveal conflicts
    - Analyze and resolve conflicts using git history

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Initialize PR Resolution

```bash
# Fetch PR info
gh pr view [PR_NUMBER] --json title,body,headRefName,baseRefName

# Checkout and rebase
gh pr checkout [PR_NUMBER] --force
git fetch origin main
GIT_EDITOR=true git rebase origin/main
```

### 2. Identify Conflicts

```bash
git status --porcelain | grep "^UU"
```

### 3. Analyze Each Conflict

For each conflicted file:

- Read the conflict markers
- Run `git blame` on conflicting sections
- Fetch commit messages for context
- Determine the intent behind each change

### 4. Apply Resolution Strategy

Based on the analysis:

- **Bugfixes** generally take precedence over features
- **Recent changes** are often more relevant (unless older is a security fix)
- **Combine** non-conflicting changes when possible
- **Preserve** test updates alongside code changes

### 5. Complete Resolution

```bash
git add [resolved-files]
GIT_EDITOR=true git rebase --continue
```

## Key Guidelines

- Always escape conflict markers with `\` when using `apply_diff`
- Document resolution decisions in the summary
- Verify no syntax errors after resolution
- Preserve valuable changes from both sides when possible

## Examples

- `/nayan-resolve-conflicts #123` - Resolve conflicts for PR #123
- `/nayan-resolve-conflicts 456` - Resolve conflicts for PR #456
